        <title>Thesis Progress - Study Complete</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The data collection portion of the research has been completed. In the end, data from seven participants was collected. One participant was forced to--more-- leave the study before completion due to personal reasons. Two other participants were generating poor data due to issues with sensor placement ( cranial size was not taken into account when selecting participants ) and a difficulty descrepency with respect to the tasks. Performance summaries and NASA TLX records have been created for each participant. While statistics have not been calculated yet, the trends seen by eye follow what was expected. Currently work is being done on scripts for the data processing, leveraging work done in my previous research with similarly formatted data. While slightly behind schedule as of now, hopefully that time can be made up within the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thesis Progress - Study Update</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The study has been going well. Currently, four participants have finished completely, five participants are partially finished, and the final participant begins tomorrow. The data collection should be concluded by the end of the week. --more--While models have not been generated yet, the subjective workload as reported by the participants aligns with the intended study design. Work is being done on scripts to display the performance metrics of each task in a more easily readable manner.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thesis Progress - The Study Begins</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The study has been approved by the Human Subjects Research Office and work began yesterday. After some trouble with sensors not connecting correctly, everything is now running smoothly. The amount of data being produced is quite large.--more-- After an initial pilot study, a few changes were made to the RanTask configurations and the tasks as a whole. Each trial is now only 10 minutes, rather than 15. This still produces a large amount of data and results in less fatigue on the participants. It was found that conditions 1 and 2 of RanTask were too similar and did not correctly induce varying levels of workload. As such, the conditions were reworked, with condition 1 counting a single tone, condition 2 counting two tones, and condition 3 counting three tones. This makes the task substantially harder, but the goal is not to have a task that everyone can complete, rather to induce different workload levels.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thesis Progress - Sensor Systems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The data logger for the heart rate sensor has been completed and is working well. This means that both sensor systems are ready and working for the study. The heart rate sensor being used is ANT+ capable so a small receiver is being used for communication between the computer and the sensor.--more-- The logging script is actually running in a virtual linux machine because the USB libraries necessary for Python to work well with the ANT library are not available for OS X. A C++ program was used in my previous study but the communication was unreliable and not suitable for an extended study. For the EEG sensors, the Emotiv Testbench application will be used to do the recording. This makes the system less streamlined but it is more reliable. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thesis Progress - Defense Date Change</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A schedule has been added to the website that will be kept up to date. The schedule in the proposal will not be changed as the proposal remain consistent with what was submitted. The thesis defense has been shifted back a day due to a scheduling conflict.--more-- This update has been reflected in the posted schedule. As tasks are completed, they will be crossed off the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thesis Progress - Proposal Accepted</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The thesis proposal was accepted today, so I am registered for thesis for the summer term. I cannot start on conducting the study yet as I have not heard back with IRB approval but work will proceed with the surrounding tools and systems.--more-- An email will be going out in the next few days inquiring about the status of the IRB form. The current plan is to have the study completed by the end of June so that I can begin the machine learning portion of the system in July.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Website Is Up!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The website is finally up. I am not a web developer, having shied away from web languages in the past, so it may take some time and trial-and-error to have everything looking nice.--more-- The majority of the site is under construction at this time. I will be adding content as I get breaks in my thesis work.&lt;/p&gt;
