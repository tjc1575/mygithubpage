        <title>Thesis Progress - Defense Date Change</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A schedule has been added to the website that will be kept up to date. The schedule in the proposal will not be changed as the proposal remain consistent with what was submitted. --more-- The thesis defense has been shifted back a day due to a scheduling conflict. This update has been reflected in the posted schedule. As tasks are completed, they will be crossed off the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thesis Progress - Proposal Accepted</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The thesis proposal was accepted today, so I am registered for thesis for the summer term. I cannot start on conducting the study yet as I have not heard back with IRB approval but work will proceed with the surrounding tools and systems.--more-- An email will be going out in the next few days inquiring about the status of the IRB form. The current plan is to have the study completed by the end of June so that I can begin the machine learning portion of the system in July.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Website Is Up!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The website is finally up. I am not a web developer, having shied away from web languages in the past, so it may take some time and trial-and-error to have everything looking nice.--more-- The majority of the site is under construction at this time. I will be adding content as I get breaks in my thesis work.&lt;/p&gt;
